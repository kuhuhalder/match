<b>Type of Application</b>: software tools for helping the users and making life easier  or software projects that solve domain specific problems

## Inspiration

The reason why we chose this project is because after being students at Rutgers University for the past 3-4 years, we have realized that knowing classmates and peers within classes is of utmost importance. It gives students a support system to go through the day-to-day challenges that each class faces and being able to share stresses, victories, and reminders with students within our classes is very helpful. We are creating a service that will allow students to meet and match with other students in the classes they are taking and form a “study buddy” relationship with them. This allows students a way to meet other students, form friendships, and gain support in classes that can be difficult. We expect to learn an ample amount of skills to accomplish this project.
