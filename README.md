## MATCH

MATCH is a web-app that pairs students to form study-buddies where students can study together. MATCH can also match students with mentors based on interests or classes mentors have already taken that the students are currently taking.

Type of Application: software tools for helping the users and making life easier  or software projects that solve domain specific problems

## Inspiration

The reason why we chose this project is because after being students at Rutgers University for the past 3-4 years, we have realized that knowing classmates and peers within classes is of utmost importance. It gives students a support system to go through the day-to-day challenges that each class faces and being able to share stresses, victories, and reminders with students within our classes is very helpful. We are creating a service that will allow students to meet and match with other students in the classes they are taking and form a “study buddy” relationship with them. This allows students a way to meet other students, form friendships, and gain support in classes that can be difficult. We expect to learn an ample amount of skills to accomplish this project.
